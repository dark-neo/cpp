 * 
 * In Java (and maybe C# and Visual Basic.NET), Interfaces only can hold method
 * prototypes, MUST BE OVERRIDEN on derived class and cannot hold attributes 
 * except public members (<-- check if this is true).
 *
 * In C++, abstract classes/interfaces MUST be an virtual method, and can
 * hold variables / private members / public members.
 *
 * C++ it's the fucking master. :P
